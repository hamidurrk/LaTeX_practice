\object{Application for LUT University Summer Internship Program – Md Hamidur Rahman Khan}
\content{
  Dear Hiring Committee, \\
  
  I am excited to apply for the Summer Internship Program at LUT University, where I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computational Engineering with a minor in Software Engineering. As an ambitious and driven student, I am eager to leverage my academic and professional experiences to contribute meaningfully to your program while further developing my technical and collaborative skills. \\

  During my studies, I have delved into programming and computational engineering coursework, including Algorithms, Data Structures, Artificial Intelligence, and Multivariate Calculus. Complementing this academic foundation, I gained hands-on experience as a Web Developer for Give Bangladesh Foundation, where I collaborated with an international team to design a fundraising platform supporting underserved communities in Kenya. \\

  My passion for innovative problem-solving is reflected in personal projects like the Network Tower Position Optimizer, which applies machine learning to optimize 5G signal distribution, and Block Meter, a blockchain-based electricity billing system that garnered national and international recognition. Furthermore, my leadership roles, such as National Coach for the World Robot Olympiad, have honed my ability to manage teams, design technical solutions, and deliver impactful presentations. \\
  
  What draws me most to the LUT Summer Internship is the opportunity to work alongside like-minded individuals who are passionate about driving change through engineering and innovation. I believe my skills in programming (Python, C++, TypeScript), proficiency with tools like Next.js and Scikit-learn, and my aptitude for bridging technical and real-world challenges align well with the program's objectives. \\
  
  I am inspired by LUT University’s commitment to sustainable solutions and its global reach. I am confident that this internship will provide the ideal environment to apply my skills while learning from experienced professionals in an engaging and challenging setting. \\
  
  Thank you for considering my application. I would be thrilled to discuss how my background, skills, and goals align with the objectives of the Summer Internship Program. Please feel free to contact me at hamidur.khan@student.lut.fi or +358 41 740 53 24. \\

}{I look forward to the possibility of contributing to and growing with LUT University this summer.}
